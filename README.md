# Deploy a Kubernetes cluster in GCP backed by Flux

Welcome to a highly opinionated template for deploying a single Kubernetes ([gke](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine)) cluster with [Terraform](https://opentf.org/) and using [Flux](https://toolkit.fluxcd.io) to manage its state.

## üëã Introduction

The goal of this project is to make it easy for people interested in learning Kubernetes to deploy a basic cluster at GCP and become familiar with the GitOps tool Flux.

This template implements Flux in a way that promotes legibility and ease of use for those who are new (or relatively new) to the technology and GitOps in general. It assumes a typical gke setup: namely, a single "gke prod" cluster running mostly third-party apps.

## ‚ú® Features

## üìù Pre-start checklist

Before we get started everything below must be taken into consideration, you must...

- [ ] bring a **positive attitude** and be ready to learn and fail a lot. _The more you fail, the more you can learn from._

## üíª Machine Preparation

### System requirements

| Role    | Cores    | Memory        | System Disk               |
|---------|----------|---------------|---------------------------|
| Control | 4 _(6*)_ | 8GB _(24GB*)_ | 100GB _(500GB*)_ SSD/NVMe |
| Worker  | 4 _(6*)_ | 8GB _(24GB*)_ | 100GB _(500GB*)_ SSD/NVMe |
| _\* recommended_ |


## üöÄ Getting Started

Once you have installed Debian on your nodes, there are 6 stages to getting a Flux-managed cluster up and runnning.

### üéâ Stage 1: Create a Git repository

1. Create a new **public** repository by clicking the big green "Use this template" button at the top of this page.

2. Clone **your new repo** to you local workstation and `cd` into it.

üìç _**All commands** during the setup process are run on your **local workstation** within your repository directory_

### üå± Stage 2: Set up your local environment

üìç _Let's get the required workstation tools installed and configured._

1. Install the most recent version of [task](https://taskfile.dev/)

    üìç _See the task [installation docs](https://taskfile.dev/installation/) for other platforms_

    ```sh
    # Brew
    brew install go-task
    ```

2. Install the most recent version of [direnv](https://direnv.net/)

    üìç _See the direnv [installation docs](https://direnv.net/docs/installation.html) for other platforms_

    üìç _After installing `direnv` be sure to [hook it into your shell](https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html) and after that is done run `direnv allow` while in your repos directory._

    ```sh
    # Brew
    brew install direnv
    ```

3. Setup a Python virual env and install Ansible by running the following task command.

    üìç _This commands requires Python 3.8+ to be installed_

    ```sh
    # Platform agnostic
    task deps
    ```

4. Install the required tools: [age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age), [flux](https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/), [cloudflared](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared), [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/), [sops](https://github.com/getsops/sops)

   ```sh
   # Brew
   task brew:deps
   ```

### üîß Stage 3: Do bootstrap configuration



### ‚ö° Stage 4: Prepare your gke configuration



### ‚õµ Stage 5: Use Terraform to install gke



### üîπ Stage 6: Install Flux in your cluster

üìç _Here we will be installing [flux](https://fluxcd.io/flux/) after some quick bootstrap steps._

1. Verify Flux can be installed

    ```sh
    flux check --pre
    # ‚ñ∫ checking prerequisites
    # ‚úî kubectl 1.27.3 >=1.18.0-0
    # ‚úî Kubernetes 1.27.3+k3s1 >=1.16.0-0
    # ‚úî prerequisites checks passed
    ```

2. Push you changes to git

   üìç **Verify** all the `*.sops.yaml` and `*.sops.yaml` files under the `./ansible`, and `./kubernetes` directories are **encrypted** with SOPS

    ```sh
    git add -A
    git commit -m "Initial commit :rocket:"
    git push
    ```

3. Install Flux and sync the cluster to the Git repository

    ```sh
    task cluster:install
    # namespace/flux-system configured
    # customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/alerts.notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io created
    # ...
    ```

4. Verify Flux components are running in the cluster

    ```sh
    kubectl -n flux-system get pods -o wide
    # NAME                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    # helm-controller-5bbd94c75-89sb4            1/1     Running   0          1h
    # kustomize-controller-7b67b6b77d-nqc67      1/1     Running   0          1h
    # notification-controller-7c46575844-k4bvr   1/1     Running   0          1h
    # source-controller-7d6875bcb4-zqw9f         1/1     Running   0          1h
    ```

### üé§ Verification Steps


## üì£ Post installation


#### ü™ù Github Webhook

By default Flux will periodically check your git repository for changes. In order to have Flux reconcile on `git push` you must configure Github to send `push` events.

1. Obtain the webhook path

    üìç _Hook id and path should look like `/hook/12ebd1e363c641dc3c2e430ecf3cee2b3c7a5ac9e1234506f6f5f3ce1230e123`_

    ```sh
    kubectl -n flux-system get receiver github-receiver -o jsonpath='{.status.webhookPath}'
    ```

2. Piece together the full URL with the webhook path appended

    ```text
    https://flux-webhook.${bootstrap_cloudflare_domain}/hook/12ebd1e363c641dc3c2e430ecf3cee2b3c7a5ac9e1234506f6f5f3ce1230e123
    ```

3. Navigate to the settings of your repository on Github, under "Settings/Webhooks" press the "Add webhook" button. Fill in the webhook url and your `bootstrap_flux_github_webhook_token` secret and save.

### ü§ñ Renovate

[Renovate](https://www.mend.io/renovate) is a tool that automates dependency management. It is designed to scan your repository around the clock and open PRs for out-of-date dependencies it finds. Common dependencies it can discover are Helm charts, container images, GitHub Actions, Ansible roles... even Flux itself! Merging a PR will cause Flux to apply the update to your cluster.

To enable Renovate, click the 'Configure' button over at their [Github app page](https://github.com/apps/renovate) and select your repository. Renovate creates a "Dependency Dashboard" as an issue in your repository, giving an overview of the status of all updates. The dashboard has interactive checkboxes that let you do things like advance scheduling or reattempt update PRs you closed without merging.

The base Renovate configuration in your repository can be viewed at [.github/renovate.json5](https://github.com/onedr0p/flux-cluster-template/blob/main/.github/renovate.json5). By default it is scheduled to be active with PRs every weekend, but you can [change the schedule to anything you want](https://docs.renovatebot.com/presets-schedule), or remove it if you want Renovate to open PRs right away. It is also configured to [automerge some updates](https://github.com/onedr0p/flux-cluster-template/blob/main/.github/renovate/autoMerge.json5).

## üêõ Debugging

Below is a general guide on trying to debug an issue with an resource or application. For example, if a workload/resource is not showing up or a pod has started but in a `CrashLoopBackOff` or `Pending` state.

1. Start by checking all Flux Kustomizations & Git Repository & OCI Repository and verify they are healthy.

    ```sh
    flux get sources oci -A
    flux get sources git -A
    flux get ks -A
    ```

2. Then check all the Flux Helm Releases and verify they are healthy.

    ```sh
    flux get hr -A
    ```

3. Then check the if the pod is present.

    ```sh
    kubectl -n <namespace> get pods -o wide
    ```

4. Then check the logs of the pod if its there.

    ```sh
    kubectl -n <namespace> logs <pod-name> -f
    # or
    stern -n <namespace> <fuzzy-name>
    ```

5. If a resource exists try to describe it to see what problems it might have.

    ```sh
    kubectl -n <namespace> describe <resource> <name>
    ```

6. Check the namespace events

    ```sh
    kubectl -n <namespace> get events --sort-by='.metadata.creationTimestamp'
    ```

Resolving problems that you have could take some tweaking of your YAML manifests in order to get things working, other times it could be a external factor like permissions on NFS. If you are unable to figure out your problem see the help section below.

## üëâ Help

- Make a post in this repository's Github [Discussions](https://github.com/onedr0p/flux-cluster-template/discussions).
- Start a thread in the `support` or `flux-cluster-template` channel in the [k8s@home](https://discord.gg/k8s-at-home) Discord server.

## ‚ùî What's next

The cluster is your oyster (or something like that). Below are some optional considerations you might want to review.

#### Ship it

To browse or get ideas on applications people are running, community member [@whazor](https://github.com/whazor) created [this website](https://nanne.dev/k8s-at-home-search/) as a creative way to search Flux HelmReleases across Github.

#### Storage

The included CSI (`local-path-provisioner`) is a great start for storage but soon you might find you need more features like replicated block storage, or to connect to a NFS/SMB/iSCSI server. If you need any of those features be sure to check out the projects like [rook-ceph](https://github.com/rook/rook), [longhorn](https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn), [openebs](https://github.com/openebs/openebs), [democratic-csi](https://github.com/democratic-csi/democratic-csi), [csi-driver-nfs](https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/csi-driver-nfs),
and [synology-csi](https://github.com/SynologyOpenSource/synology-csi).

#### Authenticate Flux over SSH

Authenticating Flux to your git repository has a couple benefits like using a private git repository and/or using the Flux [Image Automation Controllers](https://fluxcd.io/docs/components/image/).

By default this template only works on a public Github repository, it is advised to keep your repository public.

The benefits of a public repository include:

- Debugging or asking for help, you can provide a link to a resource you are having issues with.
- Adding a topic to your repository of `k8s-at-home` to be included in the [k8s-at-home-search](https://nanne.dev/k8s-at-home-search/). This search helps people discover different configurations of Helm charts across others Flux based repositories.

  <summary>Expand to read guide on adding Flux SSH authentication</summary>

1. Generate new SSH key:

    ```sh
    ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 521 -C "github-deploy-key" -f ./kubernetes/bootstrap/github-deploy.key -q -P ""
    ```

2. Paste public key in the deploy keys section of your repository settings
3. Create sops secret in `./kubernetes/bootstrap/github-deploy-key.sops.yaml` with the contents of:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Secret
   metadata:
     name: github-deploy-key
     namespace: flux-system
   stringData:
     # 3a. Contents of github-deploy-key
     identity: |
       -----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
           ...
       -----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
     # 3b. Output of curl --silent https://api.github.com/meta | jq --raw-output '"github.com "+.ssh_keys[]'
     known_hosts: |
       github.com ssh-ed25519 ...
       github.com ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 ...
       github.com ssh-rsa ...
   ```

4. Encrypt secret:

    ```sh
    sops --encrypt --in-place ./kubernetes/bootstrap/github-deploy-key.sops.yaml
    ```

5. Apply secret to cluster:

    ```sh
    sops --decrypt ./kubernetes/bootstrap/github-deploy-key.sops.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
    ```

6. Update `./kubernetes/flux/config/cluster.yaml`:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
    kind: GitRepository
    metadata:
      name: home-kubernetes
      namespace: flux-system
    spec:
      interval: 10m
      # 6a: Change this to your user and repo names
      url: ssh://git@github.com/$user/$repo
      ref:
        branch: main
      secretRef:
        name: github-deploy-key
    ```

7. Commit and push changes
8. Force flux to reconcile your changes

    ```sh
    flux reconcile -n flux-system kustomization cluster --with-source
    ```

9. Verify git repository is now using SSH:

    ```sh
    flux get sources git -A
    ```

10. Optionally set your repository to Private in your repository settings.
